Face Recognition Project
Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using the face_recognition library and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system can recognize faces from images and in real-time using a webcam. The project leverages machine learning techniques to encode faces and predict identities based on a dataset of labeled images.
