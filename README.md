# Face Recognition Project

## Overview

This project implements a face recognition system using the `face_recognition` library and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system can recognize faces from images and in real-time using a webcam. The project leverages machine learning techniques to encode faces and predict identities based on a dataset of labeled images.

## Features

- Face encoding and recognition using the `face_recognition` library.
- K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for predicting identities.
- Real-time face recognition through a webcam.
- Visualization of detected faces and names.
- High accuracy and performance metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `face_recognition`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib
